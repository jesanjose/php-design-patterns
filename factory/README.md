Factory
===================
* It is a factory of related classes that shares the same interface or base.
* This pattern lets you create instances without using the ```new``` keyword.
* Contains the logic of object creation in a single place.

#### When to use this pattern
* You have a base class that is inherited by different classes. (parent-child inheritance)
* You need to encapsulate the complex logic for instantiating/creating objects.
